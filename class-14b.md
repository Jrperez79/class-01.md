Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction.

Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams.

First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.

As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well.
But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.

The good teams all had high average social sensitivity — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. 

Once the researchers encountered the concept of psychological safety in academic papers, it was as if everything suddenly fell into place.

Research on psychological safety pointed to particular norms that are vital to success.

The behaviors that create psychological safety — conversational turn-taking and empathy — are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond. And those human bonds matter as much at work as anywhere else. In fact, they sometimes matter more.

Project Aristotle is a reminder that when companies try to optimize everything, it’s sometimes easy to forget that success is often built on experiences — like emotional interactions and complicated conversations and discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel — that can’t really be optimized.
